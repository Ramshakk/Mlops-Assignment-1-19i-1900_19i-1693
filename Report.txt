Based on the CodeQL analysis performed on the FlexGen repository, potential security vulnerabilities were found in the codebase.
The analysis identified code paths that accept parameters containing keywords such as "password," "token," or "secret," which could
be used in potentially vulnerable ways. These include functions that use insecure hashing methods or send passwords over the network
unencrypted. These vulnerabilities could be exploited by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or systems.
It is recommended that the development team review and address these vulnerabilities to improve the overall security posture of the application.
